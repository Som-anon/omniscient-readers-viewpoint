<h3>Chapter 140: Ep. 27 - Unreadable, IV</h3>
</div>
<p>[Your body has woken up due to a powerful shock.]</p>
<p>[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage 3 has been turned off.]</p>
<p>My senses gradually returned as my consciousness settled into my flesh. By the way, something was strange.</p>
<p>…Why didn't I see the resurrection message?</p>
<p>[You can't be rewarded for 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage three because of the unstable connection of 1st person supporting role viewpoint.]</p>
<p>As I was feeling surprised by this unexpected message, I slowly felt the pain and weight of my flesh. There was something wrong.</p>
<p>I saw Yoo Joonghyuk who was staring at me. Shit, I was almost surprised to death.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja, are you dead?"</p>
<p>I thought I knew a bit about what was going on. I knew why the resurrection message didn't come up and why there wasn't compensation for Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint stage three. I never died in the first place.</p>
<p>"Kim Dokja."</p>
<p>I was just hit really hard. Damn bastard, why didn't he kill me? This jerk, not killing me when I wanted to be killed…</p>
<p>「 …Should I have just killed him in the beginning? 」</p>
<p>I heard an unexpected thought and shut my mouth. Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint had automatically activated. Yoo Joonghyuk's thoughts poured in like a waterfall.</p>
<p>「 Everything is twisted because of this person. 」</p>
<p>「 It is different from what I know in the earlier regressions. The amount of information available is too limited. I can't save the world like this. 」</p>
<p>What was this?</p>
<p>「 The reason I was hurt by the Salvation Church was because I spent too much time in the last round. It was a mistake to train for 100 years then. My mind was permanently damaged. 」</p>
<p>「 Maybe it was a mistake not to get the Absolute Throne. 」</p>
<p>「 I will start from the beginning again… 」</p>
<p>Dammit, the regressor's depression had begun. Was it due to the mental attack? I cried out in fear of what he would decide. "I'm hurt you jerk!"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk looked over at my provocation and spoke in a subdued voice. "…You are the one who wanted me to kill you. Is the matter resolved?"</p>
<p>"Roughly. The urgent fire has been put out."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's expression didn't look bright so I touched my pained stomach and told him some of what I learned.</p>
<p>I told him about how Lee Hyunsung saved Jung Heewon. Of course, I didn't mention that I watched from the 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.</p>
<p>I usually would've added on a lame story but the half-hearted Yoo Joonghyuk nodded with a gloomy expression. "That is what happened. Then what are you going to do now?"</p>
<p>"I haven't decided yet but the situation is very optimistic."</p>
<p>"The woman called Yoo Sangah is important to you so you must be desperate to find her first. Was she caught by the Salvation leader?"</p>
<p>"Maybe. In any case, I am hopeful about the situation."</p>
<p>"…What is so hopeful about it?"</p>
<p>"Joonghyuk-ah, we can save the world. You know that, right?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk stared at me. "What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>I thought I was being too obvious so I added an excuse. "Well, it is like this. If my guess is correct, Nirvana wouldn't have touched Yoo Sangah. If he is the Nirvana I know."</p>
<p>"…Do you know the reincarnator?"</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk's eyes narrowed. Min Jiwon, who hadn't wanted to disturb us, finally interrupted. She had a startled expression on her face as she said,</p>
<p>"The two of you are quite familiar with each other."</p>
<p>"I'm a friendly person. By the way, are you okay?"</p>
<p>"…Thanks to you. I almost joined the Salvation Church."</p>
<p>Min Jiwon trembled because the encounter with Nirvana left a deep trauma. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to consider her situation.</p>
<p>"King of Beauty, I think I need some help."</p>
<br /><hr /><br />
<p>I started to collect the scattered people using the King of Beauty's Hwarang.</p>
<p>The urgent task was to prevent further damage from Nirvan's Thought Infection. In particular, it would be disastrous if Lee Jihye was infected with strange ideas. Then the ghost fleet on Han River would turn Seoul into a wreckage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lee Gilyoung and Shin Yoosung were in close proximity with each other and it wasn't difficult to find Gong Pildu who had occupied a building. He complained, "I wanted to stay in that land."</p>
<p>"Peace land?"</p>
<p>"Dammit…"</p>
<p>Gong Pildu seemed sorry that the previous scenario was over. Well, Gong Pildu was a king there. Han Sooyoung used to be a goddess so I wondered how she felt now.</p>
<p>"Honourable Supreme King! Please accept me!"</p>
<p>"I respect you!"</p>
<p>The flattering words that were difficult to hear came from the new incarnations who entered the scenario. The rumour that we returned from Peace Land had spread. I looked to the side and saw the frowning Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>「 Those people can't save the world, even with 100 trucks. 」</p>
<p>「 Once again, the answer is regression… 」</p>
<p>"Now now, our Supreme King isn't in a good mood right now so back off. Do you want to die?" I personally stepped forward to get rid of any causes of depression.</p>
<p>The new incarnations glared at me like fans kicked out by a celebrity's manager.</p>
<p>"Who is this bastard?"</p>
<p>"He is the Ugliest King."</p>
<p>These scum. I was going to say something when unexpectedly, Yoo Joonghyuk opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"If you want to join me, become a person who can help me."</p>
<p>Unlike usual, there was a strong melancholy in his cold voice. They were insulting words but fans truly were different.</p>
<p>"Shit, so cool… that excellent young and dark voice…"</p>
<p>The incarnations, both male and female, looked entranced.</p>
<p>"So chic! I will become stronger! I will definitely be helpful!"</p>
<p>Why was the world so unfair? By the way, why were they looking for Yoo Joonghyuk? Had they all forgotten that I was the one who overpowered the Salvation leader?</p>
<p>At this moment, someone opened his mouth. "Hey, based on what I saw earlier, the Ugly King is more powerful."</p>
<p>"Eh? Is this real?"</p>
<p>I didn't know if it was real but I was pretty strong.</p>
<p>"Are your eyes in the back of your head? The Supreme King overpowered him with one hit."</p>
<p>"Is that right?"</p>
<p>My shaking hands became heavier and I noticed that Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung had grabbed onto my hands.</p>
<p>"I think ahjussi is handsome."</p>
<p>"Hyung, the face isn't everything."</p>
<p>The only one on my side were the kids… no, Shin Yoosung. By the way, what was with the Ugly King? It seemed to be positioned as my nickname.</p>
<p>I honestly didn't understand. I had never heard the word 'ugly' used towards me until the fall of the world.</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk was depressed but I was the one who had to suffer.</p>
<p>"The Ugliest King? Ahaha! It fits really well."</p>
<p>I turned my head at the laugh and saw Lee Jihye. Almost all my party members were gathered except for Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung, who were relatively far away.</p>
<p>Then what should I do now? I had a headache.</p>
<p>At this moment, a loud sound appeared from somewhere and Yoo Joonghyuk responded first. "…A large monster species. It is 6th grade."</p>
<p>"Is there a scenario in progress here?"</p>
<p>Lee Jihye was right. The seventh scenario 'Monster Hunting' was an event scenario for incarnations who didn't participate in Peace Land and the new incarnations.</p>
<p>…Sixth grade monsters were already showing up in the seventh scenario? It was Min Jiwon who answered the questions I had. "I'm sorry but the seventh scenario is already over."</p>
<p>"…It isn't in progress right now?"</p>
<p>"You arrived around the time the rewards were given. The situation is already finished. The Salvation leader received the highest reward."</p>
<p>As expected from the Salvation leader. Speaking of which, the Salvation Church seemed to have hunted monsters when I first met the leader.</p>
<p>"Then where are these monsters coming from?"</p>
<p>"Be prepared. It isn't just one or two." Yoo Joonghyuk raised the Splitting the Sky Sword while the other party members also brought out their weapons.</p>
<p>The 6th grade heavy hounds appeared and broken buildings with huge paws. At first glance, there were more than ten of them.</p>
<p>"The sixth grade monsters shouldn't move around in groups like this. What is with these bastards?"</p>
<p>We swung our weapons at the monsters. Lee Jihye used Demon Slaying while Gong Pildu used Armed Fortress. In addition, there was Yoo Joonghyuk's Breaking the Sky Sword and Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung's Diverse Communication. Certainly, our party members were strong.</p>
<p>We cleared ten 6th grade monsters in an instant but the situation wasn't resolved.</p>
<p>Gong Pildu shouted, "They're coming again!"</p>
<p>"Everyone, come this way!"</p>
<p>I had to reduce the damage so I evacuated the new incarnations and cut off the head of the heavy hound with the Blade of Faith. Of course, I didn't forget to collect the cores of the fallen monsters.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is wondering about your reasoning.]</p>
<p>However, there was something uncomfortable. This development didn't appear in the original third regression of the novel. It didn't appear in the fourth, fifth… or even the 10th regression.</p>
<p>It felt like I was missing something important. Think. Kim Dokja. When did this scenario happen?</p>
<p>[Due to the effect of your exclusive attribute, memories from the books you have read will become stronger.]</p>
<p>…Perhaps?</p>
<p>[I wish to inform all incarnations of Seoul Dome.]</p>
<p>Then the message of the dokkaebi came. It wasn't Bihyung but a voice I was hearing for the first time.</p>
<p>[Aren't you surprised by the monsters suddenly appearing? Sigh… as you might've expected, the next scenario has started. We also wanted to give you a break… it is regrettable. This scenario wasn't created by the dokkaebi but is an automatic scenario.]</p>
<p>[A new main scenario has arrived.]</p>
<p>[Main scenario # 8 - The Strongest Sacrifice has begun.]</p>
<p>It was a different name from the eighth scenario I knew. I opened the contents of the scenario.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>[Main scenario # 8 - The Strongest Sacrifice]</p>
<p>Category: Main</p>
<p>Difficulty: S</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Survive the wave of monsters (this scenario requires caution because the rank of the monsters rises every four hours).</p>
<p>Time Limit: ―</p>
<p>Compensation: ???</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
<p>* There are additional clear conditions.</p>
<p>* Hints are provided once every four hours.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>[Ah, for your information. It starts from the 6th grade. In four hours, the 5th grade species will emerge and then four hours after that, it will be 4th grade. Then four hours later… huhu, well. Don't you know?]</p>
<p>Then one of the incarnations shouted, "What? What is an automatic scenario?"</p>
<p>"Eh? There isn't a time limit?"</p>
<p>[A time limit? Haha. There is no such thing.]</p>
<p>I knew the words were true. Nirvana appeared and Yoo Joonghyuk's party was much stronger than the original third regression…</p>
<p>I vaguely guessed what was going on. This development had appeared in Ways of Survival.</p>
<p>[It is because all of you are too strong. Oh my god, the Korean incarnations have become so strong that they don't fit the balance anymore. Aren't you being a bit too greedy? This is a scenario that automatically occurs when the incarnations of certain domes become too strong.]</p>
<p>The Seoul incarnations were at a loss.</p>
<p>[As mentioned, there are two solutions to this scenario.]</p>
<p>Additional conditions appeared in the air.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>Additional Clear Conditions (Pick 1):</p>
<p>1. The death of half the incarnations in Seoul Dome.</p>
<p>* Current number of incarnations (107,624).</p>
</fieldset>
<p>The dokkaebi spoke with admiration.</p>
<p>[Hmm, there are still so many people? It is good that it is an even number.]</p>
<p>"Shit! Don't talk nonsense!"</p>
<p>"You are telling us to just die? Dokkaebi scum!"</p>
<p>The dokkaebi smiled and added,</p>
<p>[Please calm down. There is a second condition.]</p>
<fieldset>
<p>Additional Clear Conditions (Pick 1):</p>
<p>1. The death of the strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>I understood.</p>
<p>…The name of this scenario was the 'ultimate sacrifice'.</p>
<p>In other words, even if half of Seoul didn't die, the scenario would end with the death of the strongest incarnation.</p>
<p>The incarnations shouted excitedly, "The strongest incarnation? What? Who is that referring to?"</p>
<p>"Tell us who it is!"</p>
<p>[Haha, I can't tell you that. Is it any fun if I tell you? Well, he is the strongest so he would know the best.]</p>
<p>The dokkaebi said,</p>
<p>[Then work hard to find them. Or do you already know? Perhaps the strongest incarnation is the apostle of justice who will sacrifice themselves for you. Ah, I'm a bit bored so let me give you a hint. I wish you the blessing of the story.]</p>
<fieldset>
<p>[Hint 1]</p>
<p>The tenth strongest incarnation in Seoul Dome is 'Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye'.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>"Wow, what? Nonsense. I am only 10th?" Lee Jihye grumbled.</p>
<p>However, no one was able to laugh at her. Everyone was busy watching one person. He was the person I was eavesdropping on right now.</p>
<p>「 Everything is too twisted. 」</p>
<p>「 A scenario I don't know about has appeared. 」</p>
<p>Ah, please. Yoo Joonghyuk…</p>
<p>「 I can't think of a way to fix it. Maybe I should regress… 」</p>
<p>Damn, what would happen to me if he regressed? I absolutely refused to be swept up in his death without knowing anything. I glared at Yoo Joonghyuk in front of me and formed a fist.</p>
