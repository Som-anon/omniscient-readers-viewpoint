<h3>Chapter 80: Ep. 16 – The Fifth Scenario, IV</h3>
</div>
<p>I gasped and asked, "What? Is it over?"</p>
<p>"No, that is…"</p>
<p>"…Then what am I doing wrong?"</p>
<p>"To be precise…"</p>
<p>"Don't drag it out and tell me quickly."</p>
<p>"It is all wrong."</p>
<p>It was so sincere that I sat down like I had received a nuclear punch. I breathed roughly and looked up at the sky. All of a sudden, the Great Hole floating in the sky seemed bigger. It seemed to be mocking me.</p>
<p>Lycaon looked at me and prepared for the kill.</p>
<p>"Protector… you don't have any qualities suited for Way of the Wind. No, to be honest, you don't have the qualities for almost every skill."</p>
<p>If this went wrong, the world might perish because of me.</p>
<br /><hr /><br />
<p>A few more hours passed like this and then days went by. There were eight days left until the start of the fifth scenario.</p>
<p>I didn't give up and continued to learn Way of the Wind. Of course, it wasn't possible.</p>
<p>Grrr. "Protector, it is better to give up…"</p>
<p>"…Why can't I learn it?"</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung giggled beside me and said, "Why? It is because you have no talent."</p>
<p>"That isn't possible."</p>
<p>"Why not? You aren't the protagonist. Do you think that you became Yoo Joonghyuk because you have been doing a good job lately?"</p>
<p>My chest was sore like I had been stabbed. I spoke with a frown, "But I understand everything in my head."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. Everyone thinks they can go to Seoul National University."</p>
<p>"I'm telling the truth."</p>
<p>I remembered most of the enlightenment associated with Way of the Wind. I felt so frustrated one hour ago that I got a second battery from the survivors and read the text again.</p>
<p>"There is a gale in the right hand and a storm in the left hand. The Way of the Wind will be opened when the straight lines and the curves meet."</p>
<p>"H-How… You really understand it!"</p>
<p>Lycaon felt admiration from where he was listening to me.</p>
<p>In fact, the words I just muttered was Yoo Joonghyuk's enlightenment in Ways of Survival. In Ways of Survival, Yoo Joonghyuk gained insight in a single 'phrase' followed by a Chinese character. He learned Way of the Wind in just 5 minutes.</p>
<p>But it wasn't that simple and I had wasted two days already.</p>
<p>"How can I do this?" I grumbled.</p>
<p>"Huh? You just said it… there is no representation more accurate than that."</p>
<p>"No, it was a metaphor."</p>
<p>"Your words weren't a metaphor."</p>
<p>It was enough to make me go crazy. This time the problem wasn't solved by the writer's description in Ways of Survival. It was because the explanation was just complete noise to me and the Fourth Wall was also useless at this moment. Fourth Wall gave me judgment and calmness but it didn't give me talent.</p>
<p>I felt a little feverish as I spoke to Lycaon. "Then you should try this. One wind will meet another wind to form ying and yang. Once again, one wind will meet another wind to form the principles of negative and positive."</p>
<p>Yin and Yang was a concept from Earth but Lycaon understood it instantly.</p>
<p>"How could you have gained such profound insight?"</p>
<p>"Don't just speak it, spread it directly through your body."</p>
<p>"So it is like this."</p>
<p>Lycaon concentrated and winds from different directions started to form around him. The two winds swirled, adding a hot and cold energy to the wind.</p>
<p>…To be honest, I thought it was ridiculous. He just heard it and could carry out the technique instantly? Then why couldn't I do the same?</p>
<p>My pride was provoked.</p>
<p>"Then how about this? 'Four winds meet and form a defense. Then another four winds are added, making it the Eight Trigrams. Therefore, wind is everywhere yet exists nowhere'. Can you do this as well?"</p>
<p>This sentence was the enlightenment that Yoo Joonghyuk gained in the 9th round of regression. This time Lycaon made a puzzled expression. I spoke in a triumphant voice.</p>
<p>"You can't? This is how I am feeling."</p>
<p>"Pushov… no, Protector. I really appreciate it."</p>
<p>…What?</p>
<p>[The 5th grade other world species 'Prince Lycaon of the Imyuntar' has received great enlightenment.]</p>
<p>Lycaon suddenly turned and started practicing.</p>
<p>[You have a great impact on the evolution of Prince Lycaon of the Imyuntar.]</p>
<p>[Lycaon of the Imyuntar feels a great appreciation towards you.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations from the ruined world 'Chronos' thank you.]</p>
<p>[2,000 coins have been sponsored.]</p>
<p>I finally figured out what was going on. That damn wolf gained enlightenment by hearing what I said.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung was laughing so hard that she was holding her belly.</p>
<p>I felt belated frustration. Maybe I knew Ways of Survival but I didn't know anything about myself.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' admires your patience.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is disappointed in your weakness.]</p>
<p>Looking at the system messages appearing in the air, I thought about signing a contract with a sponsor. Of course, it was impossible due to the contract with Bihyung.</p>
<p>[So why did you break the throne? Fool.]</p>
<p>I looked up and saw a transparent figure floating in the air. I opened the dokkaebi communication.</p>
<p>'Is it okay to talk now? What about the intermediate dokkaebi?'</p>
<p>[He won't come for a while. He is being properly disciplined. He won't come before the fifth scenario opens. Ah, my channel also upgraded again. Hopefully I can reach the intermediate level next month. It is all thanks to you.]</p>
<p>'That's good'.</p>
<p>[Why don't you look happy? It is also good for you if I do well.]</p>
<p>'You will be busy when you reach intermediate level'.</p>
<p>Bihyung laughed at my words.</p>
<p>[Brat, don't worry. I don't know about other incarnations but won't I look after you? These days there are many intermediate dokkaebi at the Bureau but… it is noisy because some bastards are twisting their probabilities extensively.]</p>
<p>I didn't need him to tell me who it was.</p>
<p>[Oh, of course it isn't you.]</p>
<p>It was completely Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>In fact, Yoo Joonghyuk's growth rate was impossible through any possibilities. He was growing at a rate that was close to a cheat.</p>
<p>[There is one abnormally rapidly growing guy and the Bureau can't touch him… I think his sponsor is probably a formidable guy.]</p>
<p>Perhaps Yoo Joonghyuk's 'possibilities' wouldn't be a problem in the future.</p>
<p>In the end, the 'possibility' wasn't a problem if there was a constellation capable of that 'possibility'. And it was possible for Yoo Joonghyuk's sponsor.</p>
<p>[By the way, why don't you buy a growth package? I'll sell it for a cheap price if you buy it now. Aren't you suffering right now because you can't learn that skill? This package…]</p>
<p>'I won't buy it. In any case, isn't the growth package only applicable to skills already learnt? Did you show up just to eat money?'</p>
<p>The growth package had a penalty when abused. It was why even the powerful Yoo Joonghyuk didn't use the growth package.</p>
<p>[Sheesh, you knew…?]</p>
<p>Bihyung muttered with a dissatisfied expression.</p>
<p>'But it is time to buy something'.</p>
<p>[Coins Possessed: 62,372 C]</p>
<p>I still had a lot of coins despite raising my stats due to selling the fire dragon parts.</p>
<p>If I had 40,000 more coins, I would've bought Sky Dragon Steps but I couldn't this time.</p>
<p>Bihyung's face became rosy.</p>
<p>[Oh, really? What do you want to buy?]</p>
<p>'Aren't you going to receive new coin items soon?'</p>
<p>[…How do you know? Did you plant a mole?]</p>
<p>'It is natural since a new scenario will open soon. At that time, tell me. I'll buy it'.</p>
<p>[Hoh, you will…]</p>
<p>I turned off the dokkaebi communication. I didn't want to talk to him when there was nothing to say. I looked back and Lycaon was still gaining enlightenment. Han Sooyoung approached me and raised her chin.</p>
<p>"Hey, what are you going to do now?"</p>
<p>"…I don't know. I'm still thinking."</p>
<p>"Then let me learn it."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Or let the other survivors learn it."</p>
<p>I looked at the people around us.</p>
<p>It was two days after the coin farms collapsed. The rescued survivors were working together and caring for the other wounded.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was quite different from the survivors of Deputy Yoon's coin farm. Perhaps Han Sooyoung's hypocrisy-filled good deeds had changed them. It turned out that hypocrisy was a good thing.</p>
<p>Han Sooyoung opened her mouth again. "Isn't it just learning Way of the Wind? Does it matter who learns it?"</p>
<p>"…Right, anyone can learn it."</p>
<p>"Why do you insist on being the one to learn it? Are you trying to get the attention of the constellations alone?"</p>
<p>It wasn't wrong, but it wasn't exactly right.</p>
<p>"Only people with the protection medallion can learn Way of the Wind."</p>
<p>"Then give it to me."</p>
<p>"It isn't transferable."</p>
<p>[The character Han Sooyoung has confirmed that the statement is true.]</p>
<p>This woman really…</p>
<p>"You are the first person who is more suspicious than Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>"You brought it up. This skill, Yoo Joonghyuk should've originally learnt it?"</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"Then why do you have to go through this trouble? You can leave it to Yoo Joonghyuk. It isn't too late now so let's go find Yoo Joonghyuk. He is growing well. That guy would manage it somehow."</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk doesn't listen to what other people will say."</p>
<p>"I'll tempt him."</p>
<p>I stared at Han Sooyoung before looking away. "Yoo Joonghyuk doesn't like the body of a child."</p>
<p>"Are you ignoring me now?"</p>
<p>"Besides, there is also a problem in finding Yoo Joonghyuk."</p>
<p>Even Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't learn Way of the Wind without the protection medallion.</p>
<p>It meant the medallion needed to be taken from me, but ownership wouldn't be released until I died.</p>
<p>In other words, Yoo Joonghyuk must kill me. Besides, even if he had the medallion…</p>
<p>"You know that I beat him up pretty badly in the end. Once we meet, he will definitely try to kill me."</p>
<p>Yoo Joonghyuk flew from my punch filled with 100 strength. In the meantime, the eyes that wanted to tear me to pieces were still vivid.</p>
<p>"…Well, he was really bold when he cut off my head." Han Sooyoung stroked her neck as memories of Chungmuro Station surfaced.</p>
<p>"Besides, finding out where he is now…"</p>
<p>At this time, an uproar was heard in the distance.</p>
<p>"There is someone injured. Please help! It is serious!"</p>
<p>Someone had found a wounded person nearby.</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is looking forward to your companionship.]</p>
<p>[Some constellations are expecting you to treat the wounded.]</p>
<p>The messages of the constellations, including Uriel, arrived. What was going on?</p>
<p>I took Han Sooyoung and headed there.</p>
<p>After a while, I found the cause of the problem and glared at Bihyung floating in the air.</p>
<p>Bihyung sniggered at me.</p>
<p>[I didn't know about this.]</p>
<p>The bleeding Yoo Joonghyuk was waiting for me there.</p>
