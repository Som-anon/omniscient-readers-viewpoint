<h3>Chapter 53: Ep. 11 – Night of the Prophets, IV</h3>
</div>
<p>A red aura appeared around the meteorite and glowing lights shot all over the platform.</p>
<p>"Ohh! Finally!"</p>
<p>A prophet screamed.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung quickly approached me.</p>
<p>"Run away? What…"</p>
<p>It was too late. The red aura spread across the platform and a faint veil surrounded the station. Now none of the prophets would be able to leave Anguk Station.</p>
<p>[Constellations protest against the excessive filtering.]</p>
<p>[Many constellations' eyes are shining at the 'omen'.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is watching the situation with curious eyes.]</p>
<p>[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is expecting your brilliant strategy.]</p>
<p>The constellations were excited and sent me indirect messages.</p>
<p>The most dangerous situation in the world of Ways of Survival was one where the constellations were partying.</p>
<p>I asked the nervous Jung Minseob, "Was No. 1124 the one who suggested that you gather here today?"</p>
<p>"Huh? I don't know. We all agreed together…"</p>
<p>I felt clogged up, like someone had fed me ten sweet potatoes. I couldn't believe things had gone this far.</p>
<p>–Everybody move behind me.</p>
<p>I paid attention the meteorite while protecting them.</p>
<p>–Aren't we running away?</p>
<p>–We can't go. If you look behind, you can see a ward.</p>
<p>–Huh? What ward?</p>
<p>I didn't answer as I stared at the meteorite in the centre of the platform.</p>
<p>[Meteorite] was the main event in the fifth scenario. The danger sleeping inside the meteorite would differ depending on the colour, brightness, size and type. However, the meteorite I was looking at now was one that should never hatch.</p>
<p>They seemed confused because the meteorite that gave the star relic in the third regression was 'bright red'…</p>
<p>"I wonder what star relic will appear?"</p>
<p>"That…"</p>
<p>Some prophets hadn't noticed yet and touched the meteorite.</p>
<p>[An omen of the fifth main scenario has appeared.]</p>
<p>Then the message popped up.</p>
<p>"Eh? What is this?"</p>
<p>"Why suddenly the main scenario…"</p>
<p>The surface of the meteorite cracked and a red light poured out. The first thing the light touched was the prophet staring at the meteorite with wonder.</p>
<p>The body of the prophet who lost his head slowly fell to the ground like a broken doll.</p>
<p>"What is going on?!"</p>
<p>The prophets screamed and retreated, but they were already unable to escape the crisis.</p>
<p>I took the party with me as I retreated to the edge and observed the situation. I remembered seeing this type of meteorite in Ways of Survival but it was tricky to know what would come out.</p>
<p>Please, don't let it be that 'disaster'. The meteorite cracked and red lava poured out.</p>
<p>The surrounding platform burned and released a bad smell. Then the temperature of the air rose rapidly and breathing became painful.</p>
<p>The surrounding environment was changing. This… a lava zone? It meant…</p>
<p>[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' has appeared!]</p>
<p>"Fuck! What? The star relic…?"</p>
<p>Several confused prophets belatedly used skills. However, the meteorite stretched out a long tail and caught a few escaping prophets.</p>
<p>"Kuaaack!"</p>
<p>The body of the prophet that caught by the tail suddenly burned up. Some prophets used skills to attack the tail but their weapons started to melt.</p>
<p>"T-This monster…"</p>
<p>The meteorite was at most two metres in length, but the monster crawling out from the gap was over five metres long.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon asked.</p>
<p>–What the hell is this?</p>
<p>–It is a disaster.</p>
<p>–Disaster?</p>
<p>The remainder of the meteorite split apart and a dragon species entered this dimension.</p>
<p>Kuoooooh!</p>
<p>A violent dragon that was just born. Despite being a deteriorated version of a hatchling, a dragon still reigned at the apex of all monsters.</p>
<p>A 6th grade monster could wipe out all the prophets here and this was a 5th grade fire dragon.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim!"</p>
<p>Some of the prophets called out to me and all attention was still focused this way.</p>
<p>I frowned. The incident was caused by them yet they wanted me to solve it?</p>
<p>"Get back to the edges."</p>
<p>Like an obedient puppy, everyone moved to a corner of the platform. The guys who were quick were already running upstairs from the platform. But.</p>
<p>"Shit, there's a ward!"</p>
<p>The lesser dragon was a 'disaster'. In a situation where a disaster appeared, the size of the despair was different. At least, this was the pattern I knew.</p>
<p>Among Yoo Joonghyuk's numerous regressions, he had definitely faced this guy.</p>
<p>I looked at the party members.</p>
<p>–A hidden scenario will soon start.</p>
<p>–Hidden scenario?</p>
<p>–This is a guy who shouldn't have come out in the fourth scenario. It has an unusual difficulty so there will soon be an intervention.</p>
<p>In order to respond to this disaster, various benefits were needed in the fifth scenario. For example, if the blue meteorite came out…</p>
<p>But now we had nothing. Yes, something had to be given to balance us.</p>
<p>[Some constellations are complaining about the unusual scenario difficulty.]</p>
<p>Indeed. The next moment, sparks flew in the air and a small child-like presence appearance.</p>
<p>It wasn't a low grade dokkaebi like Bihyung. He wore a tidy suit with two little horns on his head. He was an impressive guy with a small lump protruding from his side pocket.</p>
<p>I didn't know his name but I knew what he was. He was an intermediate dokkaebi.</p>
<p>[Hrmm. This is difficult. How did you guys get this 'root'? It was only installed recently…]</p>
<p>Once his voice rang out, the movements of the lesser dragon stopped. Indeed, it was possible for an intermediate dokkaebi to intervene in the scenario to this level.</p>
<p>[A disaster woke up in the fourth scenario?]</p>
<p>The emergence of an intermediate dokkaebi meant that the 'early scenarios' had almost come to an end.</p>
<p>As long as he took notice of this place, I would barely be able to see the contract benefits with Bihyung.</p>
<p>[Some constellations are poisonous so I can't spare you… it is also hard to downgrade the difficulty…]</p>
<p>His gaze focused on me.</p>
<p>"But this isn't right! We haven't cleared the fourth scenario!" One prophet shouted.</p>
<p>I could see the prophets around him quickly covering his mouth. There was nothing good about yelling at a dokkaebi right now.</p>
<p>[I have decided. I won't downgrade the difficulty.]</p>
<p>The prophets glared at the dokkaebi. There was only the sound of breathing. They had read Ways of Survival so they would know.</p>
<p>The dokkaebi couldn't overturn the laws. But they also knew this.</p>
<p>[Still… it won't be interesting if you all die this way. I will use my discretion to change the scenario content.]</p>
<p>The dokkaebi was more talkative than I thought.</p>
<p>[The hidden scenario has arrived!]</p>
<p>The lesser dragon started moving again. The red leather-covered paws hit the floor of the platform. I avoided the scattered debris and looked at the scenario that arrived.</p>
<fieldset>
<p>[Hidden Scenario – United You Die, Scattered You Die]</p>
<p>Category: Hidden</p>
<p>Difficulty: A</p>
<p>Clear Conditions: Within the time limit, hunt down the 'lesser dragon Igneel' or survive his attacks.</p>
<p>Time Limit: 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Compensation: 3,000 coins</p>
<p>Failure: Death</p>
<p>Hidden pieces are hidden in this mission.</p>
</fieldset>
<p>A 20 minute survival mission. From the title to the contents, it was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Lee Hyunsung asked.</p>
<p>–Do we have to hunt him?</p>
<p>–No, don't even dream about it.</p>
<p>This disaster is a disaster for a reason. Even the real Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't catch a 5th grade fire dragon. I looked at the situation on the platform. Flowing flames started pouring out.</p>
<p>Kwa kwa kwa kwa!</p>
<p>"Kuaaack!"</p>
<p>The prophets caught in the flames turned to ashes. The walls burned by the flames melted and distorted terribly. He was slowly moving to this side.</p>
<p>"Everyone run counterclockwise!"</p>
<p>I opened my mouth and ran ahead of the rotation direction.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung followed me well. Jung Minseob and Lee Sungkook were a bit behind but they still seemed okay.</p>
<p>This time, we avoided it because I knew the pattern. The problem was that this type of attack wouldn't always occur.</p>
<p>[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is preparing the 'Flames of Destruction'.]</p>
<p>…It had started. We somehow avoided the general attack but the crisis came now.</p>
<p>"Look for a foothold."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Number 5… or 2 and 3! Anyway, just quickly find something that adds up to 5!"</p>
<p>[A hidden piece is activated.]</p>
<p>[Numerical footholds are activated.]</p>
<p>[Once the appropriate number of people enters the foothold, 'Absolute Shield' can be activated in 10 seconds.]</p>
<p>[Absolute Shield won't activate when the number on the foothold is exceeded.]</p>
<p>The prophets all heard this system message. At the same time, footholds the size of two pyeong appeared all over the station.</p>
<p>"Footholds? Ah, right!"</p>
<p>"There is a hidden piece!"</p>
<p>I looked at the moving prophets and bit my lips. The giggling constellations reflected in my eyes. Why did many constellations protest against the difficulty of the scenario?</p>
<p>It was simple. There was no fun in a story with 'only death'. They didn't want ants being trampled by a giant. These guys wanted the ants to fight back to survive. In order to live, the ants would even bit at their kin.</p>
<p>[Many constellations are watching the situation with excited eyes.]</p>
<p>Damn constellation scum.</p>
<p>"Shit, go!"</p>
<p>"Kuheeok!"</p>
<p>The prophets, who had called each other's numbers in a friendly manner, now wielded their weapons against each other to fight over the footholds with the number '1'. Some prophets collapsed bleeding as they approached a foothold.</p>
<p>The swift prophets were already stepping on the footholds, strengthening their alertness.</p>
<p>I kept an eye on them. Someone had clearly planned this trap. Maybe they were the apostles.</p>
<p>They knew the prophets would gather her and decided to use this opportunity to wipe out those who stopped reading early.</p>
<p>It was a good idea. No matter how trivial the information, the fewer who knew the future, the better.</p>
<p>Usually, the apostles would be laughing at the prophets from far away. If they were 'ordinary' people.</p>
<p>Those who read more than 50 chapters of a boring novel weren't normal. They called themselves apostles and were greedy enough to control information.</p>
<p>'If they were intelligent enough to use the red meteor as a trap, wouldn't they know how to overcome the disaster?</p>
<p>If I was like this…</p>
<p>–Representative-nim! There is no foothold.</p>
<p>–There is nothing here!</p>
<p>Jung Heewon and Jung Minseob cried out urgently. There were no footholds in the place where out party was located.</p>
<p>–Oh, there is one here! But…</p>
<p>The foothold that was barely found had an ominous number. Four. In other words, only four people could survive on that foothold. But our party had five people.</p>
<p>[The 5th grade fire dragon species, 'Lesser Dragon Igneel' is using the 'Flames of Destruction'.]</p>
<p>A huge spark started from the centre of the platform and started to spread throughout the station.</p>
<p>It was a lesser dragon's full attack skill. The heat was enough to burn my skin despite being so far away. If the shield wasn't activated now, my party would be destroyed.</p>
<p>"R-Representative-nim?"</p>
<p>Lee Sungkook and Jung Minseob trembled as they met my gaze. I grasped the handle of Unbroken Faith.</p>
<p>At that moment.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim!"</p>
<p>I looked back and saw one prophet. The number '2' was written on his foothold. Despite the urgent situation, this man still looked relaxed.</p>
<p>"Come this way!"</p>
<p>This guy…? A few memories passed by quickly. I ran towards him while shouting at the people behind him.</p>
<p>"Activate the shield!"</p>
<p>[Absolute Shield is activated!]</p>
<p>Kuoooooh!</p>
<p>Then the flames burned everything on the platform. If it had touched me just a little bit then I would've melted.</p>
<p>"Sigh… I'm glad."</p>
<p>The man who triggered the shield at breathtaking timing sighed with relief. I asked him, "Who are you?"</p>
<p>The man laughed lightly. "I'm disappointed. Have you already forgotten? I am No. 1168. About Asmodeus…"</p>
<p>I remembered. He was the one who spoke to me about Demon King Asmodeus.</p>
<p>"That isn't my question."</p>
<p>The eyes of No. 1168 shook.</p>
<p>I hadn't thought about it before.</p>
<p>The scene of the confrontation between Demon King Asmodeus and Yoo Joonghyuk. To be precise, the second regression Yoo Joonghyuk was one-sidedly beaten by the demon king.</p>
<p>It was a scene I remembered because I really liked it. However… this recollection didn't appear before chapter 50. I could say it with certainty as the full reader of Ways of Survival.</p>
<p>I pulled out my blade and opened my mouth.</p>
<p>"I will ask you again. Who are you?"</p>
<p>[Due to the effect of your exclusive attribute, your memories of some scenes became stronger.]</p>
<p>The story of Demon King Asmodeus appeared exactly in chapter 57 of Ways of Survival.</p>
<p>A crack started to spread in this man's relaxed expression.</p>
