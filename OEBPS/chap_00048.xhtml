<h3>Chapter 48: Ep. 10 – Future War, VI</h3>
</div>
<p>It wasn't an illusion. The guy's eyes instantly widened when he heard my name.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me…?"</p>
<p>He carefully observed my face. That reminded me, what was the description of Yoo Joonghyuk in Ways of Survival? There wasn't a detailed appearance but the word 'handsome' was attached. And my face…</p>
<p>Could this be considered a fictional allowance?</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Ah, nothing."</p>
<p>His tone became politer. I didn't know what was going on in there but his head was probably in a complicated state right now.</p>
<p>At least one thing was certain. The man in front of me had clearly read Ways of Survival.</p>
<p>I became more certain because he wasn't registered in Character List and he was surprised to hear Yoo Joonghyuk's name.</p>
<p>His eyes urgently returned to Lee Hyunsung by my side.</p>
<p>It was inspecting the attribute… I see. Was he digging up information? I deliberately gave him some time to observe Lee Hyunsung before opening my mouth.</p>
<p>"Impertinent person. You better move your eyes carefully."</p>
<p>"…Heok?"</p>
<p>He confirmed Lee Hyunsung's name and also noticed that he could view my character window with Detect Attributes. I didn't know how far he had read in Ways of Survival but there were a few characteristics that could be used to identify Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>One of them was the SS skill, Sage's Eye which allowed for universal detection and protection against detection skills. Now he would be convinced that I had Sage's Eye.</p>
<p>"Did you think I wouldn't know that you peeked at me with a B-grade skill?"</p>
<p>The spasms started from the man's eyes and spread through his face.</p>
<p>Then his eyes wandered to the red flag I carried on my back. It was as I guessed. There were limits to the evidence that he could find about Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>"You son of a bitch…!"</p>
<p>One of the men in the group hadn't figured out the situation and pointed a spear at me. The moment that Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung was about to come forward.</p>
<p>Peeok!</p>
<p>The man's head burst and red blood splattered like a fountain. The group immediately screamed. From beyond the blood, I saw a serious looking man.</p>
<p>…Look at this bastard? He slowly walked through the crowd towards me.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. Such a distinguished person had to see a horrible sight."</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>The man tried to manage his expression at my cold tone. He was pretty good. If I was him, I would like like my heart was going to burst.</p>
<p>"I will formally introduce myself. My name is Lee Sungkook. I am the deputy in charge of Dongmyo Station."</p>
<p>This guy approached and bowed before me. I liked it. Then I started the full-fledged Yoo Joonghyuk cosplay.</p>
<p>After I snapped at him, I opened my mouth and spoke in a cold voice.</p>
<p>"Dongmyo Station? I see. Then get out."</p>
<p>"…Huh?"</p>
<p>"This is my station from now on so get out."</p>
<p>This guy's mouth dropped open.</p>
<p>"What…"</p>
<p>"You aren't going to listen to me?"</p>
<p>I looked down at the flag holder that had the Dongmyo flag. Lee Sungkook belatedly understood my point.</p>
<p>"T-That is impossible. You can't transfer a station already occupied…"</p>
<p>"Do you think I'm a fool? You are the deputy."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"If you have the authority of a deputy, the station can be transferred at will. You didn't know?"</p>
<p>"…!"</p>
<p>"If you don't take it out by the time I count to three, I will cut your neck. One."</p>
<p>Lee Sungkook's face stiffened. The men slowly surrounded me, giving off a nasty atmosphere. Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung were nervous because they didn't know why I was suddenly doing such a crazy thing. I continued speaking.</p>
<p>"Does it sound like I am joking? Two."</p>
<p>Was it hard to remember after reading the novel 10 years ago? It looked like he forgot who Yoo Joonghyuk was. Then I had to jog his memory.</p>
<p>[The exclusive skill 'Purest Sword Force Lv. 2' has been activated.]</p>
<p>[Blade of Faith is activated!]</p>
<p>Chiiiiiing!</p>
<p>I saw Lee Sungkook's pale face beyond the burning white blade. This was a game of chicken.</p>
<p>Remembering Yoo Joonghyuk meant he knew a bit about who Yoo Joonghyuk was.</p>
<p>If he knew how ruthless the early Yoo Joonghyuk was then he would never be able to continue this game.</p>
<p>If he didn't know Yoo Joonghyuk properly? Then it didn't matter. I would play the game and run away if we were going to lose. Now I had enough strength.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lee Sungkook hurriedly shouted.</p>
<p>"W-Wait a minute! I-I'll give it to you!"</p>
<p>This brat, he had read Ways of Survival. But he didn't read it properly.</p>
<p>"No need."</p>
<p>"…Huh?"</p>
<p>"You answered too late."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"This place isn't enough. Give me Dongdaemun as well."</p>
<p>Jung Heewon made an astonished expression by my side. She looked like she was ready to act. But she couldn't go out.</p>
<p>No, I had to act. Because I was now Yoo Joonghyuk. I had to speak more nonsense in order to make him believe I was Yoo Joonghyuk.</p>
<p>I aimed my sword at Lee Sungkook and declared.</p>
<p>"If you don't do this, there won't be a deal."</p>
<p>"B-But…!"</p>
<p>"I will count to three again. One."</p>
<p>Lee Sungkook's expression changed in real time. He was starting to believe that I was Yoo Joonghyuk. The protagonist of a novel was standing in front of him.</p>
<p>How would he cope? The way he acted here would determine my relationship with these guys in the future.</p>
<p>"I-I can give you Dongdaemun History and Culture Park! But…"</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>"I don't have the authority to hand over Dongdaemun… if you don't mind, would you like to meet our representative?"</p>
<p>It was a great response. It was just the level of prey that I wanted.</p>
<p>Lee Sungkook kept on talking.</p>
<p>"Yoo Joonghyuk-nim's reputation is well-known. Our representative will be greatly looking forward to seeing Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. Please give our group a chance to talk with Yoo Joonghyuk-nim."</p>
<p>"You know me?"</p>
<p>"How can I not know Yoo Joonghyuk-nim?"</p>
<p>Lee Sungkook shut his mouth the moment he said this. He thought he said something strange. Yoo Joonghyuk couldn't be famous this early on.</p>
<p>"A-Anyway, it will be an honour if you accompany me."</p>
<p>I stared at him and replied. Yes, this level was acceptable.</p>
<p>"Okay, show me the way."</p>
<p>Lee Sungkook's expression brightened and he added useless words.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I swear on the King's Honour that I won't harm Yoo Joonghyuk-nim."</p>
<p>[Dongmyo Station's deputy, Lee Sungkook has sworn on the King's Honour.]</p>
<p>[If he breaks this vow, Lee Sungkook can be punished by you.]</p>
<p>What a great guy. But he did the right thing if he really thought I was Yoo Joonghyuk. Wasn't his understanding of Yoo Joonghyuk better than I expected?</p>
<p>Then he would pay for it.</p>
<p>"Hurt me? You guys?"</p>
<p>"Of course, none of us can lay a finger on Yoo Joonghyuk-nim. Ha, haha. Then… this way."</p>
<p>"Just a minute."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>I pointed to the flag holder.</p>
<p>"Give me that."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>[You have received the transfer of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park.]</p>
<p>[Currently Occupied: Chungmuro (Main Base), Myeongdong, Dongdaemun History and Culture Park]</p>
<p>[The achievement points of the red flag are rising.]</p>
<p>The flag was changing before my eyes.</p>
<p>It was a good start.</p>
<p>No, wasn't this too easy?</p>
<p>"Then let's go."</p>
<p>I watched Lee Sungkook's shaking shoulders and felt strange.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be okay to continue living as Yoo Joonghyuk?</p>
<br /><hr /><br />
<p>We were guided by Lee Sungkook towards Dongmyo Station.</p>
<p>The Dongmyo members didn't know my identity but Lee Sungkook's attitude was so stubborn that they couldn't protest.</p>
<p>I walked with my party at the rear of the group. Lee Hyunsung hesitated before looking at me and opening his mouth.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Dokj…"</p>
<p>Kuk!</p>
<p>Jung Heewon noticed quickly and hit Lee Hyunsung's stomach. There was the sound of wind being blown from the lungs and Lee Hyunsung moaned.</p>
<p>As expected from Jung Heewon. She didn't know the exact situation but she knew how to match the mood.</p>
<p>I muttered out of the side of my mouth.</p>
<p>'You know what to do without me telling you?'</p>
<p>'Yes, roughly'.</p>
<p>I watched Jung Heewon and then Kang Ilhun being carried by Lee Hyunsung. The most important person right now was that guy.</p>
<p>'Make sure to restrain that guy. Understood?'</p>
<p>Jung Heewon nodded and made a strange gesture. She kneeled in front of me and cried out in an exaggerated voice.</p>
<p>"Yes Joonghyuk! I will do as you say!"</p>
<p>Anyone who saw it would think about medieval knights. The funny thing was that the surprised Lee Hyunsung did the same thing.</p>
<p>"I-I will do as you say…!"</p>
<p>Lee Sungkook, at the head of the group, was surprised to hear these two voices. It was embarrassing but the result was good. I couldn't read Lee Sungkook's inner thoughts but it would be like this if I could read it.</p>
<p>「 He must be Yoo Joonghyuk. 」</p>
<p>Lee Sungkook met my gaze and quickly turned his head back to the front. This was how a main character felt.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, we arrived at Dongmyo Station.</p>
<p>They were a pretty powerful group seeing as many people were on the platform. There were some people with weapons like Lee Sungkook's group, but most of them didn't have any.</p>
<p>They were probably wanderers from other stations who lost their group.</p>
<p>"Move faster!"</p>
<p>"I-I understand."</p>
<p>They were slaughtering the ground rats while being supervised by the Dongmyo members or disassembling the corpses of the monsters to make equipment.</p>
<p>The so-called 'slave' class. It was a common scenery in the age of kings.</p>
<p>Jung Heewon frowned.</p>
<p>"This isn't a real kingdom…"</p>
<p>I spoke to Jung Heewon.</p>
<p>"Don't be disgusted. Wait here and look at the situation."</p>
<p>"Yesss…"</p>
<p>I'm ignoring Jung Heewon and started to observe the surroundings. It was to take into account additional variables.</p>
<p>Dongmyo was quite important in the original novel. If I remembered correctly… the representative of this place was the 'invalid'.</p>
<p>But the story was likely to have changed if the Prophets intervened. I looked at the back of Lee Sungkook's head.</p>
<p>At this point, I had two questions. One, did Lee Sungkook have his own text version? Two, how many prophets were there?</p>
<p>And if I had to say a third question, did they have the same 'skills' as me…</p>
<p>It didn't seem like it. Otherwise he would've used Character List instead of Detect Attributes at the beginning.</p>
<p>Besides, he didn't seem to have the Fourth Wall when I used Character List. In other words, he was a case like Lee Gilyoung.</p>
<p>Well, I read over 3,000 chapters. It would be unfair if they received the same perks as me when they only read a few chapters.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I don't think they had a text version…</p>
<p>By the way, what was this person looking so hard at? Lee Sungkook was looking at his smartphone.</p>
<p>[5,000 coins have been invested in agility.]</p>
<p>[Agility Lv. 20 -&gt; Agility Lv. 30]</p>
<p>[An amazing agility lies in your body.]</p>
<p>I approached Lee Sungkook like a ghost.</p>
<p>"What are you looking at so hard?"</p>
<p>"H-Huh? It is nothing!"</p>
<p>The guy hurriedly hid his smartphone. It was a flash but I saw the screen. A yellow background and familiar speech bubbles.</p>
<p>I felt a sense of discomfort. If my eyes weren't wrong… I had definitely seen a chat room on the screen.</p>
<p>…The Internet? Right here?</p>
